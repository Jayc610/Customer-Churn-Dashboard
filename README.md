## 3. Executive Summary
Key findings and recommendations from this analysis are summarized below:

Contract Types:

Findings: Monthly contract customers show the highest churn, while customers with yearly contracts have better retention. New customers also tend to have lower monthly charges than long-term customers.
Recommendations:
Promote yearly contracts with smoother pricing transitions post-promotion to improve retention.
Consider loyalty discounts or promotional rates to increase customer satisfaction.
Internet Service:

Findings: Internet service customers have a higher churn rate, especially those with fiber optic service. Unlimited Data is shown to reduce churn among Light and Moderate Users, as their churn rates drop with this add-on.
Recommendations:
Improve fiber optic service quality.
Promote DSL as a potentially more stable option to boost retention.
For Light Users, consider tailored plans and packages that reflect low-usage needs.
Add-on Services:

Findings: Add-on services, specifically online security and premium tech support, have been linked to lower churn.
Recommendations:
Cross-sell these add-ons, emphasizing their benefits to encourage adoption and retention.
Customer Support:

Recommendation: Train customer support staff thoroughly to improve interaction quality, especially for high-churn customer segments.
Age Demographics:

Findings: Seniors, particularly on monthly contracts, are at a higher risk of churn.
Recommendation: Design targeted retention strategies for senior customers, possibly offering more personalized support and assistance.
Pricing and Offers:

Findings: Customers who churned with bundled services had higher monthly charges than those who stayed, often due to contract expirations.
Recommendations: Adjust pricing and retention strategies around the expiration of promotional offers to maintain long-term customer loyalty.

2. Internet Service
Findings:

Fiber optic service shows highest churn rate

Our analysis indicates that both 'Light Users' and 'Moderate Users' segments exhibit higher churn rates when they do not have the Unlimited Data add-on.
